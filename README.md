# ERROR: THE ACTIVE DURATION IS TOO SHORT WHILE REMOVING ROLE ASSIGNMENT

Greetings my fellow Technology Advocates and Specialists.

In this Troubleshooting Session, I will demonstrate, how to resolve the encountered error - "__The Active Duration is too short__" while removing PIM role assignment.

__Azure DevOps Administrator__ PIM role was assigned (Active Assignment) to the Service Principal configured as DevOps Service Connection. 

Immediately, within couple of minutes, I tried removing the assigned PIM role when I encountered the mentioned error.

__This is how it looks:-__

When tried after 5 minutes, Assigned PIM role (Azure DevOps Administrator) could be removed successfully.

__Hope You Enjoyed the Session!!!__
